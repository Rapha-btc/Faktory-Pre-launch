You're absolutely right with that clarification. Here's the updated summary:

## Transitions and Function Availability

**Period 1:**

- `buy-up-to`: Available until Period 2 starts
- `refund`: Only available if Period 1 expires without reaching criteria and Period 2 hasn't started

**Period 2:**

- Begins automatically when 20 seats are sold to 10+ users
- `buy-single-seat`: Only available during Period 2 (100 blocks)
- `set-contract-addresses`: Only available after Period 2 starts

**Token Distribution:**

- `initialize-token-distribution`: Can only be called by the DAO token after Period 2 starts and set-contract-addresses is set properly
- `claim`: Only available after token distribution is initialized

## Key Variables

- `period-2-height`: Marks successful completion of Period 1
- `token-contract`: Marks DAO token deployment and initialization (not redundant)

## Workflow

1. Users buy seats in Period 1
2. Period 2 starts automatically when requirements met
3. Multi-sig agent sets contract addresses during Period 2
4. DAO token deploys and initializes distribution (which can only happen once)
5. Users can begin claiming tokens according to vesting schedule

Each check serves a distinct purpose in ensuring correct sequencing and authorization throughout the process. The token-contract variable is indeed not redundant - it specifically marks when the DAO token has deployed and initialized distribution, which is separate from the Period 2 transition.

The critical dependency is that if `set-contract-addresses` contains any errors, `initialize-token-distribution` will fail, and since it can only be called once, this would require redeploying the entire system.
